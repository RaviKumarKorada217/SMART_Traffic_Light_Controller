# SMART_Traffic_Light_Controller
The main moto of this project is to design a Four way Smart Traffic Light Controller by input sensors and alert sensors using Verilog  	
(Intersection  of one Highway road and one Narrow road).

Our purpose is to make the existing Traffic Light System a “SMART ONE” by incorporating the specialised Timers , sensors and alerts to face any situations wisely.
